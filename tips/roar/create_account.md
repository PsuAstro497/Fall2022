### Creating an Account on Roar
(also known as ICDS-ACI)

\\

All students should [request an ACI account](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/) before the end of the __first day of class__.  
On the account request form,

- specify ebf11 as the sponsor account,
- write "ebf11 Astro-497  Fall 2022 course" into the research description box
- leave computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.)  

Students who already have an ACI account should contact Justin Petucci (jmp579@psu.edu) to request that they add your account to the Astro 497 group.

\\

The next step is to [setup your SSH keys](../sshkeys/)
