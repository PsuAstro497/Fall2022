### Setup Git

For students using Roar for the first time, open a terminal tab in your sessions, and run commands like the following from the terminal
```shell
git config --global user.email "nobody@nowhere.org"
git config --global user.name "Your Github Id"
```
You only need to do this once at the beginning of the semester.  

Some students may wish to use their actual name and email.  
Other students may prefer to use github id rather than your real name, and a non-email address like nobody@nowhere.org to protect their privacy.
Either is fine.

The next step is to [run a setup script](../initial_setup/).
