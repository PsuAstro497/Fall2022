# Review the feedback on your lab submission
Once the labs have been "graded", you can review any feedback from the instructor and/or TA.
- Browse to your github repository.
- GitHub classroom opens a pull request for each assignment automatrically
- Click _Pull Requests_, then click on _Feedback_, the name of the pull request that GitHub classroom created for us.
<!--
- In the "Checks" tab, click "Test notebook".  If there's a red x next to the "test (...)" job, then click on it to see the results of the continuous integration testing.  This should happen several minutes after you push your changes.
-->
- If you notice a problem that you'd like to fix, then you can make, commit and push more changes.
- In the Conversations tab (default), you and the instructor and/or TA can discuss the pull request in general using the text box at the bottom of the page.
- In the "Files changed" tab, the instructor and/or TA can provide comments on specific lines of your submission.
