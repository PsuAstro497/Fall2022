# Working with Labs
- [Getting setup to use Roar](../roar/)
- [Starting Pluto on Roar](../roar/pluto/)
- [Starting a lab](starting/)
- [Committing changes](commit/)
- [Submitting a lab](submitting/)
- [Logging out](../roar/exiting/)
- [Reviewing feedback on a lab](feedback/)

Hopefully, you won't need [update the file in a lab repository](updating/).  But if you do, hopefully one of the methods described in the link above will work well.
