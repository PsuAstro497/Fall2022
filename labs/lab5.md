### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Characterize the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Build a Bayesian model for astronomical observations
- Specify a prior and likelihood using a probabilistic programming language
- Perform posterior sampling 
- Qualitatively evaluate the convergence of Markov chains

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Assessing models
- Evaluating the sensitivity of results to choice of priors and likelihood.
- Evaluating the effects of model misspecification
