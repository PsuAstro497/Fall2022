- [Ex 1: Model Building I: Linear Models](https://psuastro497.github.io/lab3-start/ex1.html)


### Goals:
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Measure the orbital period of a transiting planet
- Fit a linear model to data using multipe techniques
- Check for convergence of optimization algorithm

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Transit observations
- Direct fitting of general linear models via linear algebra
- Limitations of linear models
- Loss function surface for linear models
- Model fitting via optimization of loss function
