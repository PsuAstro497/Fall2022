## Lab {{lab_num}}: {{title}}
([github](https://github.com/PsuAstro497/lab6-start))

Start {{lab6_start}} ---
Due {{lab6_due}}


### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Estimate parameter uncertainties using the bootstrap
- Assess a model using cross validation
- Estimate parameter uncertainties from posterior samples

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Characterizing the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Fitting non-linear models
- Performing Bayesian inference using a probabilistic programming language
- Assessing the convergence of Markov chains
