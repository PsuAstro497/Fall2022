- Use git
- Assign variables
- Organize code into functions
- Test functions
and reflect on their goals for the course.

- Perform other [one-time setup steps](/tips/roar/) during Wednesday's lab
- Follow [instructions to start a lab](/tips/labs/starting/) using the following link to [create your Lab 1 starter repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/eQOqR_8d)
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro497.github.io/lab1-start/ex1.html) (a Pluto notebook)
- Edit the `goals.md` markdown file.
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)

### Resources
