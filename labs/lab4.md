([github](https://github.com/PsuAstro497/lab4-start))

Start {{lab4_start}} ---
Due {{lab4_due}}


### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Assess evidence for planets based on Transit Timing Variations (TTVs)
- Assess the quality of a model that has been fit to data
- Build a more complex model based on results of analysis with a simpler model  
- Fit a non-linear model to data


Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Transit timing variations
- Residual analysis
- Using named parameters/named tuples to reduce risk of programming errors
