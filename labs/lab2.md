- [Ex 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://psuastro497.github.io/lab2-start/ex1.html)
- [Ex 2: Disaggregate Data](https://psuastro497.github.io/lab2-start/ex2.html)

### Goals:
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Download data from a url
- Read data from a deliminted file into a DataFrame
- Validate that the data was read in correctly
- Describe the basic properties of a dataset
- Make basic plots (histogram, density estimate, scatter plot)
- Peform exploratory data analysis
- Dissaggregate data by a categorical variable
- Recognize the potential impact of missing data and selection effects

Students will strengthen their understanding of the:
- Rate of exoplanet discoveries 
- Observed distributions of exoplanet mass, orbital period and eccentricity
- Relationships between these properties
