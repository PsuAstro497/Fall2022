## Course Goals
Successful students in the class will:
- Understand how astronomers detect and characterize extrasolar planetary systems,
- Learn about the current state and future of exoplanet science,
- Increase their data acumen, and
- Appreciate how building data science skills can benefit astronomy & astrophysics research.  

## Learning Objectives
Successful students in the class will:
- Ingest and manipulate data from astronomical surveys.
- Quantitatively describe the effects of exoplanets on astronomical observations.
- Build, apply, assess and update astrophysically motivated models for astronomical observations.
- Create visualizations for exploratory and explanatory data analyses of observations from exoplanet surveys.
- Synthesize the above into a dashboard to support the efficient analysis of exoplanet observations while following principles of reproducible research.
