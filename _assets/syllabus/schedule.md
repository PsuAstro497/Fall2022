## Course Content & Structure

In a typical week:  
- Friday lectures will focus on an Exoplanets topic.  
- Monday lectures will focus on a Data Science topic.  
- Wednesday computer labs will aim to combine the two.

There will be a short reading to be completed prior to class on most Mondays and Fridays.  Students will continue working on the computer lab begun on Wednesday as homework, typically due prior to class the following Monday.  Inevitably, there will be some deviations (e.g., getting started week, weeks with a holiday or exam, week of student presentations, etc.).
